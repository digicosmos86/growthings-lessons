# Introduction to Programming Sensors

### with MicroPython

The focus of this first unit is to familiarize students with basic skills of programming sensors in (Micro)Python. They will be introduced to the concept of a micro-controller and learn its difference from other computers. They will learn how to program sensors using fundamental concepts in Object-Oriented Programming and become familiar with the concept of data - what is data, why we need data, and what they can do with data.
