## Instructional Plan and Structure

Paragraphs are separated by empty lines. Use **bold** and *italics* to highlight important concepts within regular texts. [Hyperlinks](http://google.com) can be added this way. Separate code from regular texts with `inline code`. Images look like this:

If you want to write a block of Python code, use the following syntax:

``` python

from sensors import LightSensor
ls = LightSensor(port=6)
ls.get_lux()

```
